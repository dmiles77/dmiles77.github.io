## 🕵️‍♂️ Are You Stalking Me?

Well, well, well... if you've made it this far, you might just be stalking me. But don't worry, I won't call the authorities (yet).

Since you're already here, why not check out the public repos I've graciously shared with the world? You can find them on my GitHub profile.

And if you're *really* curious about my private repos... well, you'll have to ask me privately. I don't share my secrets with just anyone, you know! 😉

## 🚀 Want to Create Your Own Static Page?

GitHub Pages is so great (and free)! It's the perfect way to showcase your projects, create a personal site, or just share some cool stuff with the world.

## How This Site Was Built

This site was built using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- A touch of JavaScript
- And a healthy dose of caffeine ☕

## License

Feel free to take inspiration from my design, but please don't steal my identity. I'm quite attached to it!
